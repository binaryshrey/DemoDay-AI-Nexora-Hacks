DemoDay AI is a voice-first AI pitch coach that helps founders raise capital by practicing and refining their investor pitch through real-time AI voice conversations. Powered by ElevenLabs, Google Gemini on Vertex AI and RAG grounded in Y-Combinator startup knowledge and investor insights stored in Google CloudStorage and deployed over Google CloudRun, it enables founders to pitch out loud, handle challenging follow-up questions and receive clear, investor-grade feedback.

## Introducing DemoDay AI

DemoDay AI is a voice-first AI pitch coach platform for founders that simulates a real investor meeting end to end. Founders deliver their pitch out loud, face realistic VC-style follow-up questions and receive actionable, structured feedback on clarity, structure, fundability and concrete next steps—so they can iterate fast before real investor conversations.

Unlike expensive coaches, biased friends or slow feedback loops, DemoDay AI is built for rapid iteration: `pitch → pressure test → feedback → rewrite → repeat`. It evaluates whether an investor can repeat your company in one sentence, whether the narrative flows, what would block a partner from leaning in and exactly what to fix before the next meeting.

The experience is fully voice-driven, using natural spoken feedback (ElevenLabs + Anam) with realistic tone, pacing and emphasis. Under the hood, feedback is grounded via RAG over Y Combinator talks and Demo Day guidance, combined with your own materials (pitch deck, docs) to ensure advice reflects real investor expectations—not generic tips.

DemoDay AI lets founders:

- Practice pitches entirely through voice
- Handle tough investor follow-ups (traction, TAM, moat, GTM, etc.)
- Get optional real-time coaching mid-session
- Receive a structured post-session feedback report

### 📚RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

DemoDay AI uses RAG to keep feedback realistic and grounded.

#### Knowledge base sources

- Y Combinator Demo Day transcripts
- Founder talks
- Investor advice videos

#### Pipeline

1. Transcripts are chunked into short segments (roughly 20–45 seconds)
2. Each chunk is embedded using Vertex text embeddings
3. Embeddings + metadata are stored in Supabase pgvector
4. At runtime:
   - the user’s query (or pitch) is embedded
   - top-K similar chunks are retrieved
   - chunks are fed into Gemini as grounding context

#### Significance

- reduces hallucinations
- aligns feedback with real YC standards
- enables citations in reports (what the advice is based on)

## Core User Flow (Founder → Investor Simulation → Feedback)

### 1. Onboarding & Project Setup

The founder signs in and creates a new pitch project, defining the context the Google Gemini AI will use throughout the session.

They provide:

- Pitch length (e.g. 60s / 2min / 5min)
- Language
- Product description
- Website + GitHub Repo (optional)
- Attachments (pitch deck, docs, notes)

These inputs are:

- Stored in the project workspace
- Uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
- Indexed and embedded for retrieval (RAG)

This ensures all evaluation and questioning is grounded in the founder’s actual materials, not generic assumptions.

### 2. Start Pitch Simulation (Live Voice Session)

The founder clicks Start Pitch and enters a live, voice-based session.

The founder delivers their pitch out loud

- A Pitch Agent (investor persona) listens in real time
- The agent behaves like a YCombinator-style partner:
  - Interrupts naturally
  - Probes unclear areas
  - Challenges missing or weak signals

All interaction happens entirely through voice, simulating the flow and pressure of a real investor meeting.

### 3. Real-Time Reasoning & Questioning

During the session:

- The backend continuously:
  - Tracks what was said
  - Detects gaps, weak claims, or missing signals
  - Relevant YC / Demo Day guidance is retrieved via RAG

- Gemini uses this grounded context to:
  - Generate realistic follow-up questions
  - Provide optional in-session coaching nudges
  - Adapt questioning based on founder responses

This keeps questions context-aware, non-generic and investor-realistic.

### 4. Session Completion & Data Capture

Once the pitch session ends:

- Audio and transcripts are stored
- The session is marked complete
- A feedback-generation job is triggered asynchronously

At this point, the founder is done speaking and feedback is generated.

### 5. Structured Post-Session Feedback Report

The backend generates a comprehensive investor-style report, including:

- Category scores (clarity, problem, traction, market, ask, etc.)
- Top strengths and red flags
- Missing information checklist
- Pitch rewrite suggestions
- Follow-up questions the founder should expect in real meetings

All feedback is:

- Grounded in YCombinator guidance
- Tailored to what the founder actually said
- Focused on fundability, not polish alone

### 6. Voice Feedback Playback (Instant Absorption)

To reduce cognitive load:

- A Feedback Agent reads out a concise spoken summary
- Delivered with natural tone, pauses and emphasis
- Optionally rendered through an avatar for presence

The founder can:

- Listen immediately
- Review the full report afterward
- Iterate and start another session

### 7. Iterate Fast

Founders repeat the loop:

`Pitch → Pressure Test → Feedback → Rewrite → Repeat`

No scheduling, no bias, no waiting.

## API Overview (high-level)

#### `POST /rag/retrieve`

Use when: you need YC context snippets for a query.  
Returns: top-K relevant transcript chunks with timestamps and sources.

#### `POST /pitch/feedback`

Use when: you want a full VC-style evaluation of a pitch.  
Internally calls `/rag/retrieve` to ground feedback.  
Returns: structured scores + strengths/risks + rewrite + `tts_summary` + citations.
